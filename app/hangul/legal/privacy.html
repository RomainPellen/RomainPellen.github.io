  In the future, we may introduce optional features such as analytics, crash reporting, and payment processing (for example, Apple in‑app purchases or subscriptions). If these features are enabled, limited information may be processed to provide, secure, and improve the Service. Before enabling such features, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe the categories of data collected, the purpose of processing, and the third‑party providers involved.
